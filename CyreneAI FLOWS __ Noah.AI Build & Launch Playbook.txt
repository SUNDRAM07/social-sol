CyreneAI FLOWS <> Noah.AI Build & Launch Playbook
Build in Public → Launch → Raise → Scale
A Public Vibe-Coding & Capital Formation Playbook
________________


PHASE 0 - Pick the Idea (Before Anything Else)
Before registering, founders must do 3 things:
1️⃣ Choose a Simple, Real Problem
Ask:
* What workflow is broken on Solana?
* What repetitive task should never be manual?
* What agent would save time, money, or attention?
Good examples:
* Trading automation
* Wallet monitoring
* Agent responses
* Liquidity management
* Research pipelines
* Creator monetization flows
2️⃣ Decide What You’ll Build With trynoah.ai
Be clear:
* What does the Flow trigger on?
* What logic runs?
* What on-chain action happens?
Keep it simple for v1.
3️⃣ Create a Name + Logo
You need:
* Project name
* Simple logo (Canva is fine)
* One-line description
This is important for public credibility.

Step 2: Public Announcement Tweet
From your personal founder account:
* Announce:
   * What you’re building
   * That you’re building it in public
   * That it will launch on CyreneAIFLOWS
* Tag @CyreneAI , @CyreneAIflows and @trynoahai
Example:

Launching soon on @cyreneai @CyreneAIFLOWS.
This is your social commit.
________________


PHASE 3 - Build in Public (MOST IMPORTANT PHASE)
This phase determines how well your launch performs.
Twitter = Your Main Platform
Treat Twitter as:
* Your pitch deck
* Your changelog
* Your community hub
What You MUST Share Publicly
Post daily:
* What you built today
* Screenshots / short clips
* What broke
* What you learned
* What’s coming next
People don’t invest in finished products.
They invest in momentum.

Livestream Guidelines (Critical)
You should host at least 1–2 livestreams before launch.
Livestream Best Practices
* Good lighting on your face
* Clean background (not fancy, just clean)
* Share screen while building
* Walk through:
   * The problem
   * The Flow logic
   * Live progress
This builds trust at scale.
________________


PHASE 4 - Community Connection
Your job is to help people emotionally connect with what you’re building.
Always Explain:
* Who this is for
* What pain it removes
* Why automation beats manual work
* Why Solana makes this possible
Invite feedback.
Reply to every comment.
Build with your audience, not for them.
